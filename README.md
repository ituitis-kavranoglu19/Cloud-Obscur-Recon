# Cloud-Obscur-Recon
_Unmanned Aerial Vehicles_ are the general name for a very wide selection of flying devices,
and military is one of the most eager parties that wants to use them in different use cases. As a group,
we believe one of the most beneficial applications of UAV/drones would be in reconnaissance area.
Our project, **CloudObscur** tries to rethink recon missions using UAV’s which allows it to redefine
what scouting means. With the usage of high-tech, highly varied drones in such missions, most of
the limitations that comes from typical recon methods would simply vanish with the usage of these
devices. Some examples to such kind of limitations that could be lifted are identifying friendly factors
from enemy, not alerting the enemy while scouting an area, working in conditions that would be very
hard or even impossible for human pilots to navigate. Other points that would be improved by
technology includes image processing and coordination between different sources of imaging.
Similar problems and possible solutions will be examined upon in our poster. Of course, while drones
would resolve some logistics problems, they would also raise some other questions that we didn’t
consider until now. Since human conscience are almost impossible to code into a machine, lots of
ethical points stay unanswered for situations in which robots are in charge. For example, what would
happen if the drone saw something in the area it was scouting that needs urgent intervention? Should
it consider the integrity of its mission, or should it prioritize aid to those in need? Or, what should be
the approach to privacy while recording these scans of land? How should this change while imaging
more densely areas? We will try to answer these ethical dilemmas in our poster.  

Finally, we will touch on similar applications, their issues and how to improve on them. We
think our project may be adapted to civil application areas, so we will try to widen the areas of this
application as a conclusion.
